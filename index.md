## Experience

### __China Agricultural University, Research Experiences for Undergraduate__  `2018.9 - Present`

__Penrose__ is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics using two domain-specific languages: __Substance__ and __Style__. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.
